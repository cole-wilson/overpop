I chose to focus on overpopulation because I believe it is an important
issue that must be dealt with soon before we reach Earth's carrying capacity.

Overpopulation is a problem that isn't talked about much compared to other important
issues like climate change. However, overpopulation could pose a real threat to our planet and ourseleves very soon.

The following interactive slides will go more in depth into the subject of Earth's human overpopulation problem.

# Human Impact

Humans are involved in overpoplation because we are mainly the ones causing it: there are about 7.6 Billion of us! (As of 2021.)

There are many human impacts that cause overpopulation. These include some of the following:

 - One human impact is the decrease of the death rate. The decrease of this rate means that less children are dying, so more of them will grow up to have children of their own.<br>While it's good less people are dying, this will drastically increase the overall population, which isn't good.<br>![Graph of infant mortality rate](https://ourworldindata.org/exports/child-mortality-by-income-level-of-country_v2_850x600.svg)<br><caption>Infant mortality rate from [Our World In Data](https://ourworldindata.org/child-mortality)</caption>

 - Another human impact is improved agricultural and industrial tools, making it easier for people to get and create what they need. This also contributes to bringing the mortality rate down as well.

 - Additionally, poverty is also a large factor in overpopulation. People in less developed countries often do not have access to proper healthcare and family planning, which can lead to increased fertility rates. Countries such as <m>Niger</m> and <m>Angolia</m> are underdeveloped, and have the highest birth rates in the world.

 > There are many factors and causes that contribute to Earth's overpopulation, but the above are some of the most impactful.

These impacts relate to our biosphere and the space arund it because we only have 1 Earth ,and we are quickly reaching it's carrying capacity. However, a solution to this may lie outside of our biosphere and in another one somewhere else.

# Direct Negative impacts

There are many serious impacts of overpopulation, some that are already quickly becoming out of hand.

 - **Deforestation:** One of the environmental impacts of overpoplation is that we are consuming more and more non-renewable natural resources to meet our increasing needs. In turn, less trees can decrease the Earth's ability to capture CO<sub>2</sub> and therefore can increase the rate of climate change. The graph below shows the deforestation rates of <m>South East Asia</m>, <m>the Congo Basin</m>, and <m>the Amazon Rainforest</m> growing over time.<br>![Deforestation of regions over time graph](https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2016/effectsofpas.jpg)<br><caption>Graph of deforestation of regions over time, [source](https://phys.org/news/2016-07-effects-tropical-deforestation-felt-years.html)</caption>

 - **Agricultural Impacts:** Another large impact of overpopulation is the increased need for food. Farmers must resort to intensive farming that can harm the natural world. According to a [study published by the UK Government](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/65505/6316-drivers-deforestation-report.pdf), farming causes over 80% of the world's deforestation.

 - **Decreased Quality of Life:** With population density growing, and resources decreasing, quality of life, especially in undeveloped countries will decrease. Unless we can do something quickly about rapid population growth, this will continue indefinitely.

There are many people to which the issue of population overgrowth is important. Mainly, this is true in lesser developed countries where the effects of overpopulation will be felt first, but everyone in the world is affected. 

Mainly, activists and organizations looking to stop population overgrowth are trying to make sure that in 100 years, our children and grandchildren will still be able to live an adequate life, and not have to worry about overpopulation any more than we do.

# Potential Solutions

There are many solutions that can drastically decrease population growth, keeping it at an acceptable rate. 

There are three solutions that I will be focusing on in the following three slides.

# Education & Healthcare

<audio src="/audio/s6.mp3" id="a"></audio><button style='	cursor: url("/img/speaker.png") 31 31,auto!important;' onclick="document.getElementById('a').play()">Play Narration</button><button style='	cursor: url("/img/speaker.png") 31 31,auto!important;' onclick="document.getElementById('a').pause()">Pause Narration</button>


<content>

Proper education and healthcare is a very important way to stem population growth. If individuals have access to proper education and healthcare, then they are able to make better choices and family planning. This can decrease fertility rates, which will decrease the total population.

In addition, better healthcare will also decrease infant mortality rates, which will prompt families to have less children, as more will survive.

This solution has been proposed plenty of times, and has seen success in some underdeveloped countries. 

I believe that this solution will work, but in some regions it will be hard to provide healthcare and education quickly. In a long term sense, this may be the most effective solution to curb population growth and fertility rates.

# Develop Nations

<audio src="/audio/s7.mp3" id="a"></audio><button style='	cursor: url("/img/speaker.png") 31 31,auto!important;' onclick="document.getElementById('a').play()">Play Narration</button><button style='	cursor: url("/img/speaker.png") 31 31,auto!important;' onclick="document.getElementById('a').pause()">Pause Narration</button>

<content>

Developing undeveloped nations will move those nations up to the level that the United States and other highly developed countries. Research shows that more developed nations (see graph on slide 2) lower mortality rates, and decreased fertility rates.

In underdeveloped countries such as Niger and Angolia, the birth rates are the highest in the world. Strengthening their economomy and providing support to the nations will raise their level to more developed countries. This again will cause decreased fertility rates, lessening to total amount of children per family.

This solution is likley the most effective, as it also ties in healthcare and education. It is not likely a goal that can be reached soon however, as achieving this will take lots of resources and will take some time.

# Other Places

<audio src="/audio/s8.mp3" id="a"></audio><button style='	cursor: url("/img/speaker.png") 31 31,auto!important;' onclick="document.getElementById('a').play()">Play Narration</button><button style='	cursor: url("/img/speaker.png") 31 31,auto!important;' onclick="document.getElementById('a').pause()">Pause Narration</button>

<content>

Finding other places to live is a last measure sort of solution, though I believe that it is the one that will be most effective.

Already, many people such as Elon Musk have proposed this solution, saying that we will eventually outgrow Earth so we should look for alternative planets like Mars. Many billions have gone into creating the techology that would be neccesary to travel in space to another planet.

While I believe that other solutions will be effective, they will most likely nly be temporary stopgaps. They may work for hundreds of years, but eventually I believe that we will have to look for other places to live.

This need for another place is accentuated by the fact that climate change is rapidly making Earth uninhabitable, and will likely make it completely so before overpopulation does.
