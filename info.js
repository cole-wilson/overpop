# Overpopulation

by **Cole Wilson**

<content>

I chose to focus on overpopulation because I believe it is an important
issue that must be dealt with soon before we reach Earth's carrying capacity.

Overpopulation is a problem that isn't talked about much compared to other important
issues like climate change. However, overpopulation could pose a real threat to our planet and ourseleves very soon.

The following interactive slides will go more in depth into the subject of Earth's human overpopulation problem.

# Human Impact

<content>

There are many human impacts that cause overpopulation. These include some of the following:

 - One human impact is the decrease of the death rate. The decrease of this rate means that less children are dying, so more of them will grow up to have children of their own.
